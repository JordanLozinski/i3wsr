i3wsr - i3 workspace renamer
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/roosta/i3wsr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/roosta/i3wsr)

`i3wsr` is a small program that uses [I3's](https://i3wm.org/) [IPC Interface](https://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html)
to change the name of a workspace based on its contents.

## Details

The chosen name for a workspace is a composite of the `WM_CLASS` X11 window
property for each window in a workspace. In action it would look something like this:

## Installation
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), and [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/) is
required, and `i3wsr` can be installed using cargo like so:

```sh
cargo install i3wsr
```

Or alternatively, you can build a release binary,

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Then place the built binary, located at `target/release/i3wsr`, somewhere on your `$path`.

### Arch linux
If you're running Arch you can install either [stable](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3wsr/), or [latest](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3wsr-git/) from AUR thanks to reddit user [u/OniTux](https://www.reddit.com/user/OniTux).

## Usage
Just launch the program and it'll listen for events if you are running I3.
Another option is to put something like this in your i3 config

```
# cargo
exec_always --no-startup-id $HOME/.cargo/bin/i3wsr
# AUR
exec_always --no-startup-id /usr/bin/i3wsr
```

### Options

You can configure icons for the respective classes, a very basic preset for font-awesome is configured, to enable it use the option `--icons awesome` (requires font-awesome to be installed).

If you have icons and don't want the names to be displayed, you can use the `--no-names` flag.

For further customization, use the `--config path_to_file.toml` option. The `toml` file has to fields, `icons` to assign icons to classes, and `aliases` to assign alternative names to be displayed.

Example config can be found in `assets/example_config.toml`

```toml
[icons]
# font awesome
TelegramDesktop = "ï‹†"
Firefox = "ï‰©"
Alacritty = "ï„ "
Thunderbird = "ïƒ "
# smile emoji
MyNiceProgram = "ðŸ˜›"

[aliases]
TelegramDesktop = "Telegram"
"Org.gnome.Nautilus" = "Nautilus"

[general]
separator = "î‚±"
default_icon = "ï„‘"
```

For an overview of available options

```shell
$ i3wsr -h
i3wsr - i3 workspace renamer 1.2.0
Daniel Berg <mail@roosta.sh>

USAGE:
    i3wsr [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help        Prints help information
        --no-names    Set to no to display only icons (if available)
    -V, --version     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <config>    Path to toml config file
        --icons <icons>      Sets icons to be used [possible values: awesome]

```

## Configuration

This program depends on numbered workspaces, since we're constantly changing the
workspace name. So your I3 configuration need to reflect this:

```
bindsym $mod+1 workspace number 1
```

If you're like me and don't necessarily bind your workspaces to only numbers, or
you want to keep a part of the name constant you can do like this:

```
bindsym $mod+q workspace number 1:[Q]
```

This way the workspace would look something like this when it gets changed:

```
1:[Q] Emacs|Firefox
```
You can take this a bit further by using a bar that trims the workspace number and be left with only
```
[Q] Emacs|Firefox
```

## Test environment
To run the tests `Xvfb` needs to be installed and run:

```shell
Xvfb :99.0
```
This sets up a headless x server running on DISPLAY :99.0, then some apps needs to be run in this new server:

```shell
env DISPLAY=:99.0 gpick
env DISPLAY=:99.0 i3 -c /etc/i3/config
```

i3-wm through its IPC interface and
